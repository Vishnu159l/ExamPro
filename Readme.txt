index.html is the starting file i.e home page of the website
if unable to login from the deployed link it might be because the server is not live 


if the server is not live follow these steps:
    1) open terminal and run cd "<directory the examPro file is store>/Backend/".
    2) run python server.py (now the server is live).
    3) once the server is live you can open the index.html i.e home page and signup and login (if you dont have a account).
    4) also if you want to get malpractice mail to your gmail then goto line 22 in server.py and change the FACULTY_EMAIL to "yourmail".

after the server is live:
    1) if you signup and login you wont see anything in the dashboard as you didnt register for any course and dont have any performance detail
    2) if you want to visually see how the dashboard and performance tab works try to login using
